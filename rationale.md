# Validation of Answers

### Word Cloud Generation

In the `generate_wordcloud` function, the abstracts are extracted from the processed XML files, and a word cloud is generated based on the words found in these abstracts. To validate this:

1. **Extraction of Abstracts:**
   - Abstracts are extracted using the `parse_xml` function with the "abstract" extraction mode.
   - This extraction method is validated by manually inspecting a few processed XML files and confirming that the extracted text corresponds to the abstract section.

2. **Word Cloud Generation:**
   - The WordCloud library is used to generate the word cloud.
   - Validation involves visually inspecting the generated word cloud (`/app/data/output_individual_assessment_1/wordcloud.png`) and ensuring that the prominent words are relevant to the abstracts.

### Figure Visualization

The `visualize_figures` function creates a bar chart showing the number of figures per article. Validation steps:

1. **Extraction of Figure Counts:**
   - Figures are extracted using the `parse_xml` function with the "figures" extraction mode.
   - This extraction method is validated by comparing the extracted figure counts with a manual count of figures in a subset of XML files.

2. **Bar Chart Generation:**
   - The matplotlib library is used to create the bar chart.
   - Validation involves verifying that the generated bar chart (`/app/data/output_individual_assessment_1/figure_visualization.png`) accurately represents the number of figures in each article.

### Link Extraction

The `extract_links` function extracts links found in each article and writes them to separate text files. Validation steps:

1. **Extraction of Links:**
   - Links are extracted using the `parse_xml` function with the "links" extraction mode.
   - Validation involves inspecting the generated link files in the `/app/data/output_individual_assessment_1/links_results` directory and confirming that the links are relevant to the content of each article.

2. **File Output:**
   - The function creates separate text files for each article's links.
   - Validation involves checking a subset of generated text files to ensure that the links are correctly written.

## General Workflow

The general workflow involves initializing the data directory, processing PDF files using the Grobid client, and then executing the main analysis functions. The validation of the general workflow includes:

1. **Data Directory Initialization:**
   - The `init_data_dir` function checks and creates necessary directories.
   - Validation involves verifying that the required directories (`input_pdf`, `output_grobid`, and `output_individual_assessment_1`) are correctly created.

2. **Grobid Processing:**
   - The Grobid client is used to process PDF files and generate XML outputs.
   - Validation involves ensuring that the XML files are correctly created in the `output_grobid` directory.

3. **Main Analysis Execution:**
   - The main analysis functions (`generate_wordcloud`, `visualize_figures`, `extract_links`) are executed after Grobid processing.
   - Validation of these functions has been covered individually as described above.

In summary, the rationale provides a comprehensive validation process for each functionality implemented in the `main.py` script and the `utilities.py` module. The manual inspection steps ensure that the generated visualizations and extracted information align with the expected results.
