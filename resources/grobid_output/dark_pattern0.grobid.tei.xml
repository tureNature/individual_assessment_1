<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The problem of "Dark Patterns" in user interface/user experience (UI/UX) design has proven a difficult issue to tackle. Malicious and explotitative design has expanded to multiple domains in the past 10 years and which has in turn led to multiple taxonomies attempting to describe them. While these taxonomies holds their own merit, and constitute unique contributions to the literature, their usefulness as separate entities is limited. We believe that in order to make meaningful progress in regulating malicious interface design, we must first form a globally harmonized system (GHS) for the classification and labeling of Dark Patterns. By leaning on network analysis tools and methods, this paper synthesizes existing taxonomies and their elements through as a directed graph. In doing so, the interconnectedness of Dark patterns can be more clearly revealed via community (cluster) detection. Ultimately, we hope that this work can serve as the inspiration for the creation of a glyph-based GHS for the classification of Dark Patterns.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>After various catastrophes regarding the inadequate research and risk communication regarding chemicals, it was decided at the 1992 Rio Earth summit to begin the formation of a Globally Harmonized System (GHS) for the classification and labeling of chemicals <ref type="bibr" coords="1,241.63,476.79,17.01,8.74" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. An international team of experts was posed with the task of creating immediately intelligible warning labels and data-sheets that could unify hazard communication globally. This was a response to tragedies like DDT, Asbestos, and Thalidomide. These products did exactly what they promised. DDT kills insects, asbestos is an excellent insulator, thalidomide relieves symptoms of morning sickness. However, the unintended damage caused by their use was immense. Similarly, the design of shopping apps help in finding something to buy, the design of social media applications facilitate connection, and video games can be a pleasurable experience that builds communities and forms friendships. Unfortunately, often cooperate greed is the driving force behind system design, and the so called "Dark Patterns" <ref type="bibr" coords="1,372.14,596.34,10.52,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> in the interface design transform seemingly harmless benefit-providing systems into instruments of user exploitation. Predatory Monetization <ref type="bibr" coords="1,293.07,620.25,17.78,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, exploiting obsession <ref type="bibr" coords="1,401.91,620.25,12.30,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and disguised data collection <ref type="bibr" coords="1,199.04,632.21,16.13,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref> are examples of dark patterns in the design of interactive technologies. The massive and unconscious exposure to dark patterns can lead users to waste time and money, to frustration, and even to mental health issues.</p><p>Yet many users are either unaware that they are victims of deliberate design "traps" or acquiesce to use the application because it offers some functionality they need. If there were a unified system for labeling dark patterns in user interface design, it would be possible to regulate their use similar to the regulation of harmful chemicals. It would also be possible to educate consumers and create appropriate warnings in the description of interactive applications that use such patterns. Our vision is that a Globally Harmonized System for Dark Patterns in software interface design is needed and our work presented in this paper is a step in this direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and Related Work</head><p>This section provides an overview of the previous works on dark patterns that we are aware of and defines the research questions we set out to answer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Regarding "Dark" Patterns</head><p>The term "Dark Pattern" (DP) was coined by Harry Brignull, a UK-based user experience designer and consultant, in 2010. Brignull identified deceptive User Interface (UI) techniques that trick users into actions they might not have otherwise taken and created a website to raise awareness about them. This term has since become widely recognized in discussing and critiquing unethical design practices in digital interfaces. Recently, there has been some controversy over the phrase, and motions have been made to replace the term with "Deceptive"/"Manipulative" Design. We consciously made the choice to stick with the original term because alternatives (i.e. "Deceptive") describe only a part of what such patterns can achieve. Manipulation, coercion, and exploitation are equally common outcomes of interaction with these designs. Thus relegating them to simple deception limits our perception of their depth. This is not to downplay the legitimate concern surrounding the use of the term "Dark" patterns, related to a possible connotation with race, but for a lack of a commonly used and familiar term in UI and UX literature that encompasses all the possible different aspects of these designs, we will use "Dark" in this paper. Next, we present briefly the existing classifications of dark patterns since 2010.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Related Works</head><p>The first taxonomy of dark patterns by Brignull (2010) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,381.05,572.43,10.52,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> was derived through personal observations and reporting, without a documented methodology of its creation. Although Brignull's work lacks scientific rigour, it captures the essence of dark patterns and is considered a seminal work in the area. The taxonomy of Conti &amp; Sobiesk (2010) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,271.25,620.25,10.52,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref> focused on dark patterns across domains. A year-long study involving 22 undergraduate students gathering dark patterns was combined with input from roughly 75 participants of the "Hackers of Planet Earth" Conference to create a multi-dimensional taxonomy of Dark Patterns. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,227.45,118.99,15.50,8.74" target="#b20">[21]</ref> focused on the domain of games. It was constructed by considering system interaction as a contract from which ethical boundaries could be derived between users and designers. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,313.58,142.87,118.70,8.77" target="#b10">Greenberg et al. (2014)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="3,435.93,142.90,14.61,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, using the "affinity diagramming" practice, clustered and speculated upon examples of potential dark-pattern utilization within the context of Proxemic Interactions . Rooted in the domain of user privacy, Bosch et al. (2016) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,415.60,178.77,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> constructed their taxonomy by considering established privacy design patterns and deriving dark patterns from their antithesis. These derived patterns were then evaluated against the known DPs at the time (i.e. Brignull's). This work was considered as a potential basis seeing as its roots in design standards makke it domain independent, however its focus on privacy makes it less generally applicable than Ahuja et. al's <ref type="bibr" coords="3,191.37,250.50,10.40,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,207.92,250.50,10.30,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>). Grey et al. (2018)'s taxonomy <ref type="bibr" coords="3,370.51,250.50,15.50,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref> was constructed from examples across domains. Examples of dark patterns were collected, catalogued, and sourced iterativly over 2 months. The constant comparison method <ref type="bibr" coords="3,442.20,274.41,19.37,8.74" target="#b16">[17]</ref> was then applied along with document analysis to describe the nature of the dark patterns found, categorized according to Brignull's <ref type="bibr" coords="3,352.17,298.32,12.06,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> taxonomy before being recategorized via open coding. The resulting taxonomy is thus structured around dark strategies and designer motivation rather than around context and content as Brignull's <ref type="bibr" coords="3,209.39,334.19,11.79,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The Norwegian Consumer Council (NCC) (2018) analyzed the design and wording of update prompts from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft from a data protection standpoint after GDPR regulations were enacted <ref type="bibr" coords="3,164.35,370.05,12.68,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Situated in the domain of "Home Robots", Lacey &amp; Caudwell (2019) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,170.28,382.01,15.50,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref> did not explicitly propose a taxonomy, but their work was flagged as such by Ahuja et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,232.84,393.96,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for its proposal that "Cuteness" can be a dark pattern because a robot's "cuteness" encourages users to overlook or completely miss their devices' data-collecting capabilities. By crawling and scraping image samples from various e-commerce sites, Mathur et al. (2019) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,406.25,429.83,15.50,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref> abstracted a set of five dark pattern attributes, which were then applied to 15 dark patterns within 7 super-categories, some of which have direct counterparts in Brignull's taxonomy <ref type="bibr" coords="3,182.54,465.69,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The National Commission for Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) (2020) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,210.76,477.65,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> built their taxonomy with the goal of consumer protection, though no formal methodology was documented in the document. Many of its items tie directly to Brignull's original set (i.e. "Trick Question" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,407.88,501.56,13.18,8.74" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,421.06,501.56,8.79,8.74" target="#b5">6]</ref>) while others simply go by another name (i.e. Brignull's "Bait and Switch" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,413.62,513.51,13.37,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and CNIL's "Bait and Change" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,212.63,525.47,13.70,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). Grey et. al (2020)'s work <ref type="bibr" coords="3,361.65,525.47,10.52,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref> focused on "Asshole Design" as flagged by users of the Social Media platform Reddit. Posts on Reddit were analyzed and open coded through several rounds of iterative content analysis. This process rendered six dark patterns. Bongard-Blanchy et al. ( <ref type="formula" coords="3,454.07,561.31,21.22,8.77">2021</ref>) administered an online survey to participants with the aim of gauging user awareness of dark patterns. The patterns used to measure user awareness constitute Bongard-Blancey's contribution to the area of dark pattern taxonomies <ref type="bibr" coords="3,444.39,597.20,13.35,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Using techniques inspired by Value Sensitive Design and scenario construction, Mhaidli &amp; Schaub (2021) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,267.44,621.11,15.50,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref> critically examined some potential advances in virtual/augmented/mixed reality (XR) technology regarding their ethical implications. Scenarios and narratives were constructed and used to generate a set of five dark patterns that could operate in this space. Petrovskaya &amp; Zendle (2021) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,168.96,130.95,15.50,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref> focus on the issue of Predatory Monetization in the domain of games. By using the United Kingdom's unfair trading regulations, researchers released a survey requesting reports of unfair/aggressive monetary encounters online. The results were transformed into a two-tiered collection of 36 dark patterns in eight super categories. Westin &amp; Chiasson (2021) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,344.04,178.77,15.50,8.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref> likewise focused on a single dark pattern -"Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) centric design" -in the context of user privacy. By utilizing inductive grounded theory, researchers dimensionalized and categorized design interactions to pose the idea that the core issue is not with individual patterns but with their aggregated effects within "dark digital infrastructure" . Wu et al. ( <ref type="formula" coords="4,292.44,238.52,21.22,8.77">2021</ref>) generated their taxonomy by observing and coding live-stream shopping interactions on Taobao and TikTok. This taxonomy is interesting, but focuses more on the habits of the streamers than on interface design <ref type="bibr" coords="4,200.42,274.41,16.52,8.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Many of their identified patterns have been removed from our integration process for this reason. The work of Ahuja et al. ( <ref type="formula" coords="4,433.47,286.34,21.22,8.77">2022</ref>) unifies existing taxonomies with respect to their relation to user agency. This is, to our best knowledge, the most recent work in the area. It was able to describe and categorize many existing taxonomies and provides a good basis for further unification and integration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Summary and Outlook: Synthesizing Existing Taxonomies</head><p>As previous taxonomies become the fuel for the next, existing literature seems to have entered an endless cycle of splitting and joining dark pattern types. It appears that research in Dark Pattern taxonomies has reached a saturation point and researchers should begin the work of their integration to create a global standard if we are to mitigate dark patterns to any meaningful capacity -a process which this work strives to begin.</p><p>Our work represents an effort in this direction. We do not define any new dark patterns but instead seek to reveal which of the existing ones are prevalent, which ones are so similar that can be considered the same, and to uncover how dark patterns relate to each other by representing all taxonomies within a single graph (with a couple of exceptions that are too domain specific). Using methods borrowed from network analysis we reveal naturally forming communities of dark patterns. We must clarify that we use the term "community" in the sense it is used in the area of network analysis, as a group of nodes that are similar in some specific features. The dark pattern communities provide a level of abstraction that can simplify the task of identifying the pattern employed by a suspect UI as it can be compared / contrasted with other patterns in the relevant community. Our future work will define also heuristics against which suspect UI designs can be evaluated with respect to their "darkness".</p><p>The paper focuses on the following research questions:</p><p>2.4 Research Questions -RQ1: What general Dark Pattern communities emerge from existing literature? -RQ2: Can a process of heuristic evaluation be used to identify Dark Patterns based on these emerging communities?</p><p>In the next section we present the methodology we used to construct the integrated Dark Patterns taxonomy and the resulting communities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>To construct this integrated taxonomy, we started with the most comprehensive taxonomy to date (Ahuja et al. 2022 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,289.44,273.05,12.36,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>), and reviewed the papers relating to its contained taxonomies. In fact, the early versions of our taxonomy were simply verbatim graphical representations of Ahuja et al.'s work. What we add to Ahuja et al.'s, as well as other taxonomies, is that we make explicit the relationships between their contained dark patterns. This allows to describe in detail exactly how they relate within different contexts.</p><p>When seeking to graphically represent an integrated taxonomy, many of the previously mentioned taxonomies were considered as a base-taxonomy. We settled on using Ahuja et. al's work they have unified more previously defined taxonomies similar works. What further distinguishes this taxonomy is its roots in philosophical conceptualizations of autonomy. By basing the taxonomy in ideals rather than specific domains, applications, or common industry practice, its potential for generalization exceeds that of many taxonomies while being able to completely describe them. Thus, it provides a solid foundation for building systems that can track and identify recurring dark patterns across domains. Moreover, while Ahuja et al.'s work does define some of its own taxonomy items, the majority of them come from previous work. In doing so, Ahuja et al. not only provides a common mapping, but does not further dilute the Dark Pattern space, making the construction of our initial graph trivial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Process</head><p>Our first step was to represent he Ahuja et al.'s, taxonomy graphically. We chose to use a directed graph with two node types and two edge types. Taxonomy Nodes are nodes with represent taxonomies, and are named after their first author. These nodes have only outward edges toward Pattern Nodes. Pattern nodes have incoming edges from either patterns that implement/employ them, or from the taxonomy they belong to. Likewise, pattern nodes only have outgoing edges to patterns that they implemented, or employed (utilized). This allows us to reveal which patterns are most commonly used/implemented across the taxonomies by finding the pattern node with the highest number of incoming links or in-degree.</p><p>In the first version of the graph, Ahuja et al.'s taxonomy was followed exactly with no modifications (i.e. merging similar patterns). Minor versions (i.e. 2.1, 3.2) were formed by analyzing the literature surrounding similar patterns, and making an informed decision to merge them into a single node. Each iteration of this process constituted a minor revision. A log of which nodes were merged and why can be found in our project wiki(LINK REMOVED FOR BLIND REVIEW).</p><p>We used an iterative process of community detection and node merging based on pattern similarity to refine our graph. For this we used a software tool for network analysis called Gephi.</p><p>Taxonomy Version 1: The first version of the taxonomy (1.0) is a verbatim representation of Ahuja et al.'s <ref type="bibr" coords="6,267.24,215.32,10.40,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> original taxonomy node/edge policy. Once this taxonomy had been added, each of the taxonomies surveyed by Ahuja et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,470.07,227.27,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> were added in stages along with any patterns that did not make it into Ahuja et al.'s original graph. This constituted version 1.1.</p><p>Taxonomy Version 2: The second version of the taxonomy sought to reduce duplicates and condense the graph to a saturation point (no merge-able nodes exist). Though time constraints prevented us from reaching saturation, emergent communities were evident even after only a few iterations of the process described in Figure1.</p><p>Taxonomy Version 3: Although we are still discovering the occasional merge candidate, version 3 of the graph is nearly saturated. This iteration of the taxonomy removed the Author-type nodes to reduce the graph complexity and improve the ability of community detection to reveal prominent patterns and clarify their interrelation. It also eliminated single-node communities either by integration into larger communities, merging with identical nodes, or removal due to irrelevance. This is the version of the graph that we have based our analysis on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Node-Merging Process</head><p>1. Utilizing Gephi, we ran the Fast Unfolding algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="6,379.88,451.17,13.15,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref> with a resolution of 1.0 on a randomized version of our graph to detect communities amongst the nodes. We noticed that running detection would often produce a varying number of communities so the detection was run five times with the number of communities discovered most often being selected at the end. Should there be a tie, the next tie breaking occurrence would be selected. 2. After communities were detected, they were analyzed for patterns similar enough to have their nodes merged, or related enough to form an edge that was not previously identified in literature. When such nodes were found, they were flagged as a merge candidate and the process continued. 3. Once all of the change candidates were identified, the reasoning behind their merge/new relation was explained, documented, and either approved or rejected. 4. Approved merges and edges were enacted on the graph which would result in a new minor version and signify that the process could iterate once again. 5. Once saturation of nodes is reached the graph has been condensed enough, and the iteration can cease. See Fig1 for a graphical representation of this process. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Detected Communities and Prominent Nodes</head><p>The full integrated taxonomy is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="7,342.05,440.20,4.24,8.74" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.In our research, we detected 10 communities centered around 4 major patterns (Information Hiding, Deceptive Information, Forced Action, and Misleading Information). In this section we shall discuss these communities and their contained nodes in detail from largest to smallest community in terms of members. Due to space constraints the graphs representing in detail each community can be found in Appendix available online.</p><p>Forced Action -Main Pattern: Forced Action This community captures dark patterns which use their design to force or otherwise bend users into certain interaction patterns. Many of the DPs it contains come from the games domain, through gamification however, they exist in nearly any interactive system. Whether in the form of prompts that must be forcefully dismissed by the user (Nagging <ref type="bibr" coords="7,210.57,571.95,17.80,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Interruption <ref type="bibr" coords="7,286.75,571.95,12.41,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>), monetary barriers to system use (Pay to Win/Skip &amp; Pay or Wait/Grind <ref type="bibr" coords="7,284.97,583.90,18.20,8.74" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,303.17,583.90,13.65,8.74" target="#b20">21]</ref>), or barriers demanding data in exchange for the service(Impenetrable Wall <ref type="bibr" coords="7,315.02,595.86,12.36,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>), the patterns in this community restrict or coerce users into behaving a certain way.</p><p>Deceptive &amp; Misleading Information -Main Patterns: Deceptive Information, Misleading Information This community deals with cases where the information presented to the user is not necessarily false but is deceptive or misleading in a way that meets the designers goals to influence the users. This includes cases where user interactions with the UI lead to unexpected or contradictory results (i.e. Wrong Signal <ref type="bibr" coords="9,275.99,130.95,11.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Manipulating Navigation <ref type="bibr" coords="9,400.79,130.95,13.22,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>) and when the UI has lead the user to believe things about products that are untrue.</p><p>Regarding Consent -Main Patterns: Lack of Consent, Implied Consent This community contains patterns which relate to users ability/inability to consent as well as scenarios where their consent was blatantly ignored. Patterns like "Automating the User Away" <ref type="bibr" coords="9,284.73,195.16,14.94,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref> remove the ability for users to consent while patterns like "Trick Question" <ref type="bibr" coords="9,293.20,207.12,13.57,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> raise issue about whether consent was informed. This community also deals with the common scenario of default settings being skewed to meet the goals of the designers over the users through patterns like "Bad Defaults" <ref type="bibr" coords="9,242.94,242.98,12.56,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, "Default Sharing" <ref type="bibr" coords="9,338.79,242.98,12.88,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This community also seems to have captured cases where visual interference and bias have played a role in influencing user interaction as it contains patterns like Misdirection <ref type="bibr" coords="9,422.86,266.89,12.62,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Interface Interference <ref type="bibr" coords="9,183.83,278.85,16.36,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and Visual Bias <ref type="bibr" coords="9,273.76,278.85,12.01,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Information Hiding -Main Pattern: Information Hiding With an in-degree of 27, Information Hiding is the most utilized pattern in the taxonomy. None of the other nodes in its community have near the same amount of utilizations though they appear to converge around the theme of monetization, specifically in-game currencies. Seeing as in game currencies serve to hide, obscure, or otherwise disconnect user cognition of the actual value of items for sale <ref type="bibr" coords="9,441.14,352.80,15.28,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, this would make sense. Likewise, if we wanted to stop a user from comparing two products (Price Comparison Prevention <ref type="bibr" coords="9,305.71,376.71,13.26,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> or Comparison Obfuscation <ref type="bibr" coords="9,438.22,376.71,13.03,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>), hiding this information from the user will achieve this goal.</p><p>Regarding Emotions -Main Pattern: Emotional Bias This community comprises patterns which induce and/or exploit user emotions. Emotional Bias is the engine behind patterns like "Limited Time Offers" <ref type="bibr" coords="9,355.08,426.75,16.84,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref> which can induce "fear" of loss. "Confirmshaming" <ref type="bibr" coords="9,251.91,438.71,10.52,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is another long-standing pattern in the DP space. It is difficult to determine when a line is crossed to make some of the patterns of this community exploitative. When we use an interface that suits our needs and helps us to achieve our goals, we feel good. Does this mean that the interface is utilizing dark patterns as it "Induced Artificial Emotions" <ref type="bibr" coords="9,385.59,486.53,18.95,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>? Not necessarily, good UI/UX design should by its nature be pleasant to interact with, or at least deliver an experience that both the user and the designer are expecting. An interface pattern containing an appeal for donation from the user if they enjoy the software would not be considered a dark pattern, even if it happens to evoke a feeling of shame in the user because the intention in the design is obvious and there is no hidden manipulation. If emotions are induced such that they put the user in a state to the benefit of the designer, they cannot truly be said to be behaving as they would normally. Whether or not an offer is legitimately "Limited Time", communicating this to the user with the goal of purposefully inducing fear/panic of missing an opportunity is emotionally manipulative and exploitative.</p><p>Lack of Options -Main Pattern: Lack of Options The "Lack of Options"[1] community is quite similar to that of Forced Action. This is because when presented only a limited and curated set of potential interactions, users are essen-tially forced into choosing a path forward, none of which may be agreeable to them. A common example of this is in any "Terms of service" agreement. This is not to say that all such agreements are innately dark, only that they can be used to achieve patterns like "Bundled Consent" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,357.16,154.86,13.83,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref> where users must accept aspects of a system that they may not agree to in order to achieve others. This community also features many game-specific patterns to the effect of: "Pay or interact with an incomplete, under-powered, or useless system" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,406.84,190.72,17.66,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This essentially infringes on user agency by offering the ultimatum: "Play by our rules, or do not play". Users could, of course, take their business elsewhere but this too runs into a "lack of options" problem. Competitors may not deliver the desired quality and are likely offering their own ultimatum to users anyway, so again users are essentially forced into compliance for lack of desired options.</p><p>Regarding Privacy -Main Pattern: Privacy Zukering This community captures patterns involved in tricking users into sharing as much data as possible. Privacy Zukering is a pattern that has stood the test of time. For example "Obscure" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,207.68,301.10,14.00,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and "Information Framing" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,345.47,301.10,13.71,8.74" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,359.18,301.10,9.14,8.74" target="#b6">7]</ref> constitute patterns that can achieve Privacy Zukering, whereas "Forced Enrollment" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,402.19,313.05,15.50,8.74" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,417.68,313.05,7.75,8.74" target="#b4">5]</ref> and "Safety Blackmail" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,179.79,325.01,13.51,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> are examples where it is applied. Though this community is small, it reveals the mechanics of data collection and forms that it might take.</p><p>Pressurizing -Main Patterns: Scarcity, Time Pressure, Urgency This community deals with patterns that pressurize the user. This is normally rooted in "Time Pressure" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,217.50,375.60,13.08,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> but is further specialized into instances of "Scarcity" or "Urgency" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,176.06,387.56,18.35,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, both of which have denote actions with consequences if not acted upon soon. Patterns in this community usually create an emotion -fear of missing an opportunity, so there are links between the patterns in these communities.</p><p>Friction -Main Pattern: Asymmetric Effort Previous version of the graph struggled to separate "Asymmetric Effort" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,321.73,438.15,12.25,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> from "Forced Action" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,429.73,438.15,12.72,8.74" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,442.45,438.15,12.72,8.74" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,455.16,438.15,8.48,8.74" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,463.64,438.15,12.72,8.74" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Asymmetric effort simply deals with scenarios where the effort to preform an action are disproportionate to the effort required to undo them. Design friction describes ways in which effort can be increased/reduced within a UI, some of which are represented within this community (i.e. "Obfuscating Settings" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,464.23,485.97,12.27,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Obstruction <ref type="bibr" coords="10,183.15,497.93,17.59,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Bosch Outcasts -Main Patterns: Maximize, Preserve Occasionally in the graph construction process, certain communities remain around their defining author. This was often the case when the items defined in their taxonomy were not easily linked to rest of the graph. Such communities were labeled "outcasts". We speculate that this community has remained outcast because of its unique construction. Reversing privacy-by-design principles to form their taxonomy members put them at a higher level of abstraction. "Maximize" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,449.98,584.39,14.43,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for example, is similar to the concept of "Privacy Zukering" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,390.02,596.34,13.43,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> but at a system level, that is, a system can maximize the amount of user data collected through Privacy Zukering. Similarly "Preserve" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,301.18,620.25,13.21,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> exists on a system level and describes scenario's where user data is stored in a non-aggregated form <ref type="bibr" coords="10,412.14,632.21,12.57,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. "We never Forget" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,165.52,644.16,17.57,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and "Unintended Relationships" <ref type="bibr" coords="10,326.55,644.16,17.52,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref> are examples of patterns (outside of Bosch et al.'s) that may preserve data this way, though because the data lives on the server-side, this could not be discerned by a user. If anything, the fact that this community has remained outcast for 3 series of revisions suggests a gap in our reduction process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>First we will revisit our research questions to asses if our work was able to address them. Then we will look briefly at the implications of our work with respect to the construction of a Globally Harmonized System (GHS) for dark patterns formulated through heuristic evaluation before detailing our road-map for the project in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Research Questions Revisited</head><p>Now that we have a better idea of what the integrated taxonomy contains, we will return to our research questions.</p><p>RQ1: What general Dark Pattern categories emerge from existing literature? The present of the graph (3.2), continues to reveal distinct DP communities as we outlined in section3.2 RQ2: Can a process of heuristic evaluation be used to identify Dark Patterns based on emerging categories?</p><p>We attempted to form heuristics out of the resulting graph as early as version 2.1 and though it did render results, they are only meant as a proof of concept 3. Current work on this front is applying Straussian Grounded Theory <ref type="bibr" coords="11,436.09,427.26,18.72,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref> using the Dark patterns in version 3.2 and their definitions as source material in an effort to contextualize the patterns and explicitly define their relation to one another. We will revisit this in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Future Work</head><p>As we progress to the next stage of our work, applying Straussian Grounded Theory <ref type="bibr" coords="11,162.84,524.61,18.72,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref> (SGT), we have discovered only a handful of new merge candidates. Because of this, we anticipate reaching a final set of Dark Patterns shortly after we complete the axial coding. Future work focuses on using SGT to contextualize and define edge types (relationships) between dark pattern nodes (i.e. consequence of, cause of, property of, etc.). Preliminary efforts on this front have already shown promising results. SGT has also helped in the identification and categorization of dark patterns, their properties, and dimensions. Higher-level categories rendered by this process, along with the graph, will serve as a foundation to construct and justify design heuristics capable of identifying malicious design. Finally, we will construct examples of a glyph-based hazard communication system by mapping heuristic violations to glyphs that can be included in the application/game description to inform users, similar to the example shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="12,151.28,118.99,4.13,8.74" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. With these examples completed, we will evaluate the system's understandability, clarity, and applicability to malicious interfaces across different domains (e-commerce, social media, games) with law students, UI designers, and users. We hope that our work will inspire regulators, industry standards developers, software professionals, and UI designers to implement a GHS-similar standard notation to warn and protect users from dark patterns in interactive applications. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>Everyday interaction with computers has become an essential prerequisite to participating in our society. If the majority of users are exposed to, but unaware of, dark patterns, the potential for harm and exploitation is unacceptably high. A domain-independent, universally understood language describing dark patterns is a critical prerequisite to creating regulation that can outlaw the most harmful dark patterns and also effective user education.</p><p>The integrated taxonomy presented here does not claim to be the ultimate solution to the issue of hazard classification and communication in UI/UX design. To define a language or classification system with that rigour would require an international, interdisciplinary team of experts akin to that which formed the GHS for hazardous materials. The contribution of our work is in demonstrating a method for creating an integrated taxonomy based on all available previous ones. By integrating the strongest examples of Dark Pattern taxonomies in a graph structure, bolstered with heuristics to evaluate against, our work could serve as a starting point for developing a GHS for dark patterns.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="7,138.71,382.61,337.93,7.89;7,139.68,115.84,336.00,252.00"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
