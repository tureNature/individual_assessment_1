<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Dark patterns are increasingly ubiquitous in digital services and regulation, describing instances where designers use deceptive, manipulative, or coercive tactics to encourage end users to make decisions that are not in their best interest. Research regarding dark patterns has also increased signifcantly over the past several years. In this systematic review, we evaluate literature (n=79) from 2014 to 2022 that has empirically described dark patterns in order to identify the presence, impact, or user experience of these patterns as they appear in digital systems. Based on our analysis, we identify key areas of current interest in evaluating dark patterns' context, presence, and impact; describe common disciplinary perspectives and framing concepts; characterize dominant methodologies; and outline opportunities for further methodological support and scholarship to empower scholars, designers, and regulators.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Tactics of technology manipulation-often described through the concept of "dark patterns" <ref type="bibr" coords="1,147.57,604.76,12.04,8.97" target="#b2">[3]</ref>-are increasingly ubiquitous in digital services, and regulators are beginning to act in banning the most aggressive practices under consumer protection and data privacy law <ref type="bibr" coords="1,333.92,268.71,9.44,8.97" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,345.91,268.71,6.29,8.97" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Almost since the beginning of this term being coined in 2010, HCI scholars and practitioners have been central to this discourse, an area that is only rising in prominence and volume of research publications. As Lukof <ref type="bibr" coords="1,455.12,301.58,10.68,8.97" target="#b7">[8]</ref> reported in a 2021 CHI workshop on "dark patterns," scholarship on the topic is quickly rising within the HCI community and beyond, from a small trickle in the mid-2010s to more than two dozen publications per year starting in 2021. Obi et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,386.28,345.42,14.85,8.97" target="#b10">[11]</ref> similarly reported a rise in conversations about dark patterns on Twitter over this time period, demonstrating that not only is the issue of dark patterns of increasing interest and concern, but this discourse also involves a broader range of stakeholders over time-beginning with designers and technologists and now including social scientists, computer scientists, journalists, regulators, and law scholars.</p><p>While scholarship on the topic of dark patterns is quickly increasing, it is unclear which types of deceptive design practices need to be better understood, which types of patterns produce the most harm, and what kinds of studies regulators and legal professionals need to efectively identify, characterize, and sanction the use of dark patterns in technology systems. In this work-in-progress paper, we examine prior scholarship on dark patterns-including the breadth of methods and contexts employed and common framings and disciplinary motivations for studies-allowing us to identify opportunities for new research that both extends the state of the art and produces action in the form of practitioner guidance and regulatory sanctions. Additionally, our description of existing methods, contexts, framings, and contributions used in studies provides a pathway for scholars new to the space to explore avenues for contribution while also allowing existing researchers to better understand this emerging area of study. Our contributions in this PWIP work are two-fold. First, we describe a work-in-progress analysis of common framings of dark patterns scholarship, including dominant methodologies, contexts, and disciplines. Second, we offer provocations for future scholarship opportunities, gaps, and areas of tension.</p><p>(summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,135.41,86.92,2.88,8.97" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). All stages were carried out by an research team comprising six members that had previously engaged in dark patterns scholarship including investigators located in the United States, Luxembourg, and India.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Literature Collection and Screening</head><p>We conducted a search on Google Scholar and the ACM Digital Library using the search string "dark patterns" (with quotation marks) on September 13, 2022. This search returned 6,810 results in Google Scholar, and 183 results in the ACM DL (sorted by "relevance" in both databases) with no flters used to limit the search results. We downloaded the frst 249 results from Google Scholar<ref type="foot" coords="2,248.55,207.90,3.38,7.27" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and all 183 results were downloaded from the ACM DL, all as BibTeX. We then loaded all BibTeX entries into Rayyan.ai 2 , a tool for collaboratively conducting systematic literature reviews. Based on our review of the resulting 432 titles and abstracts, 64 duplicate records were identifed and removed. In addition, 25 records that were not written in the English language were removed. Finally, we attempted to download the full text of the remaining 343 reports and were able to retrieve all but two reports.</p><p>We then screened the remaining reports for eligibility. The following four inclusion criteria were: 1) the record had to be written in English; 2) the record had to mention "dark patterns" explicitly in the full text; 3) the record had to be published in a journal, conference proceedings, government technical report, or similar archival venue; and 4) the record had to include at least one empirical component. We excluded reports based on the following factors: reports that used an ineligible publication type (e.g. popular press article, only an abstract, workshop paper, student thesis, preprint; n=89); reports unrelated to computing or dark patterns (e.g., medical or hard science publications; n=17); reports that did not use dark patterns as a primary analytic or conceptual framing (e.g., only referencing the term in an introduction or conclusion; n=131); and reports which were not empirical in their framing (e.g., no new data collected or analyzed; only focused on argumentation; n=25). These criteria resulted in the exclusion of 262 reports from this review. This procedure resulted in 79 reports that were eligible for the analysis phase of our review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Literature Analysis</head><p>To analyze the included literature, we used inductive qualitative content analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="2,117.43,541.06,10.69,8.97" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to answer the following questions: 1) What is the dominant context being addressed?; 2) What method(s) are used to empirically investigate instances of dark patterns?; 3) What framing concept(s) are used to motivate the study of dark patterns; 4) What is the publication type?; and 5) What appears to be the primary feld for the intellectual contribution? To achieve this goal, four researchers on the team read the abstracts and relevant portions of the reports to ensure inclusion and code the selected records. The coding dimensions varied depended on the record and its contents. For example, a paper may contain more than one study on dark patterns and include varied evaluation methods and contexts. We began with a preliminary round of codes generated by the principal investigator based on an initial review of more than half of the dataset with sub-codes for each area of evaluation. This analysis was then supplemented by a review of fve randomly distributed reports in the dataset by four other researchers to confrm the relevance and breadth of the preliminary codes, resulting in the addition of multiple sub-codes. Initial analysis work informed our creation of a codebook (Table <ref type="table" coords="2,444.01,163.64,2.97,8.97" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), which we then used to code the entire dataset of 79 reports. One researcher coded all reports and then confrmed with at least one additional researcher. The principal investigator also provided consistency checks of codes across the entire dataset, engaging in conversation with the other researchers to reach full agreement on all application of codes. All categories of codes were applied non-exclusively except for the "framing" codes which we applied exclusively. Our fnal code application and codebook are included as supplemental material to extend our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">FINDINGS</head><p>We describe the outcomes of our analysis in relation to the context(s) addressed in the reports, the use of methods to support scientifc inquiry, the framing and related contribution of the studies, publication type, and relevant disciplinary perspective of the publication venue. We report on the sub-codes we identifed and focus on trends and gaps that we observed, supporting provocations for future work in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Context(s) Being Studied</head><p>There was a broad diversity of contexts of study described in numerous ways, which we characterized as specifc functionality or domains and genres of sites or services. The current landscape of research on dark patterns focuses disproportionately on genres where interaction occurs (e.g., social media, games, e-commerce; n=67) compared to precise indications of interface functionality, domains of use, or framings of interaction that include the use of dark patterns (e.g., consent banners, subscriptions, social robots; n=22).</p><p>• Genres: Our dataset included studies focused on many diferent genres of sites and services. Genres included games (n=7), advertising (n=2), travel services (n=2), social media (n=15), e-commerce (n=6), and mobile apps (n=7). Many studies also included a mixture of many diferent kinds of web services or genres which we coded as digital services (n=27). • Specifc Functionality: Studies were also framed based on the presence or impact of dark patterns in specifc moments of interaction (e.g., consent banners), interactive fows (e.g., subscriptions), and interaction domains (e.g., social robots, VUIs, physical computing). By far, the most common functionalitydriven approach to studying dark patterns was consent banners (n=16). Subscriptions were far less commonly studied with only one contribution. Emerging domains of interest in relation to dark patterns were also infrequently studied, yet likely to be important in future dark patterns research, including studies involving voice user interfaces (VUIs; n=1), social robots (n=2), and physical computing interactions (n=2)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Method(s) Used to Study Dark Patterns</head><p>The most common method used to study dark patterns was content analysis (n=36), through which scholars evaluated interface elements and identifed whether they contained dark patterns or not. In some studies, content analysis was central to the study, but in other reports, content analysis was used to identify the presence of dark patterns that is then used to frame an experiment. The second most common method was experimental (n=14), in which the study included control and treatment groups to study the efects of particular design elements on user behavior. This method was particularly common in the context of consent banners, with half of the reports focusing on consent banner elements' impact on user behavior. The third most common method was surveys (n=10), used to gather users' behaviour, attitudes or opinions. Literature review of previous studies (n=8), the use of case study methodology to deeply interrogate the presence and/or impact of dark patterns (n=8), design-focused methods that involved the creation of new artifacts (n=7), observations (n=6), interviews (n=6), and web measurement (n=5) represent the remaining methods used in the reports we analyzed. The majority of studies attend to the existence of dark patterns through evaluation of the constituent elements in user interfaces, with less attention to the efects of dark patterns on users. Although these approaches might help policymakers and agencies in their consumer protection investigations, it may not contribute to a better understanding of the impact of dark patterns on users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Framing of the Contribution</head><p>Reports included difering framings representing diferent methodological goals and limitations, which refected the primary intent of the research contribution. A descriptive framing, using examples to illustrate the power, impact, or attributes of dark patterns, was the most prominent in our dataset (n=19). Notably, reports with this framing were often addressing issues in new contexts or through new approaches, and many of these reports utilized case studies or content analysis to support their contribution. A problematizing framing, identifying limitations of the taxonomies and fnding gaps in the literature was the second most common approach (n=16). These reports also tended to use qualitative approaches, such as interviews, case study methodology, or content analysis to extend the literature base and identify areas for further study at scale. Reports with an experimental/causal framing sought to identify generalizable causal mechanisms relating to the presence of dark patterns, representing the third most common framing (n=15). Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of these studies used an experimental were the least common, describing the creation and deployment an automated detection technique. Altogether, the diversity of framing contributions within the dark patterns literature revealed particular dimensions of dark patterns scholarship that could be used to inspire future research studies within and across these framing categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Contribution Type and Field</head><p>Conference publications were the most common, with 59 articles published at various conference venues, while journal publications (n=19) and a workshop paper (n=1) were less common. The articles published at these venues came from diverse disciplinary perspectives. Although we coded only at the report level and did not investigate individual authors, HCI venues were the most dominant at 40 articles. Other contributing disciplinary venues included Game Studies (n=5), Privacy and Security (n=4), Computing (n=20), Communication (n=1), Human Factors (n=1), Design (n=1), Marketing (n=1), Law (n=1), Tourism (n=1), Business (n=1), Rhetoric (n=1), and Others (n=5).These disciplinary perspectives implicitly surface the range of felds and knowledge bases that have been potentially impacted and interested in studying the manifestations of dark patterns. These articles were submitted to diverse-and generally high-prestige venues-including HCI venues with high impact potential (e.g., CHI (n=17), DIS (n=4), CSCW (n=6)) and other computing venues that show the growing reach of dark patterns scholarship across international and non-US/EU populations (e.g., contributions in Brazil and India) and in relation to other computing perspectives (e.g., privacy and security; computing education; information systems; health informatics). However, because few studies reported the populations that they studied, it is difcult to assess specifc trends-although it is clear that future research should embrace greater population diversity to address regional and culturally-specifc manifestations of dark patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PROVOCATIONS TO GROW AND SUPPORT A FUTURE LANDSCAPE OF DARK PATTERNS SCHOLARSHIP</head><p>Building on our analysis of the current empirical landscape of dark patterns scholarship, we are able to show not only the breadth of study designs, contexts, and framings, but also emerging consensus on best practices to continue to grow scholarship in this important area. In this section, we provide a set of provocations for future work to extend guidance on dark patterns. These provocations outline some emergent challenges and areas of scholarly consensus, and indicate some qualities of future scholarship that could increase the translation of eforts among scholars, design and technology practitioners, regulators, and legal professionals in the battle against dark patterns. Dark Patterns Scholars Should Build Alignment and Community Norms. The diversity of the scholarship we analyzedacross difering methodological traditions, contexts, and felds of study-is a strength, revealing the harms of dark patterns in many of the systems that defne our technologically-mediated existence. However, this diversity also comes with potential risks if we do not fnd areas of alignment and empirical norms. We prefer to think of these risks as opportunities rather than explicit gaps, since considerable and converging scholarship has already laid the groundwork for the empirical challenges that come next. First, as observed by Mathur et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,104.47,470.49,10.68,8.97" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and others, there is a lack of shared vocabulary which could be constructively addressed through the creation of a shared ontology to align scholarship across type and discipline. First steps towards this goal have been recently published by Gray, Santos, and Bielova <ref type="bibr" coords="5,127.25,514.32,9.39,8.97" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, but substantial work remains. Second, we observed methodological pluralism across the landscape of scholarship which is a sign of strength, but within specifc context and methodology categories, validity or reliability threats were present in some studies. For instance, there was variable quality in arguments derived from literature review-focused studies, and experimental studies also included difering levels of rigor depending on how they operationalized dark patterns (and at what level of granularity). To further support ecological validity, future work should also identify the kinds of demographic characteristics that should be collected for replication and shared knowledge building, alongside an evaluation of the ecological validity of various methods to address specifc detection challenges. Third, we found distinct silos of diferent study framings but few connections across these silos. For instance, are there better ways for scholars to connect evaluation, problematization, and detection-oriented work? If we can solve this challenge, it could increase the translational efectiveness of the work, including new opportunities for transdisciplinary engagement and social impact via legal and regulatory channels that can leverage knowledge built through empirical studies.</p><p>Dark Patterns Scholars Should Outline Methodological Strengths and Weaknesses. We observed clear "types" of papers that also point to dominant methodological traditions. These types include: exploratory work to identify what dark patterns look like in specifc places, naming their presence; experimental work to characterize the diferential impacts of dark patterns building on existing typologies and exploratory work; and detection-oriented work that describes the presence of characterizable dark patterns at scale. Within each "type," there are common combinations of methods used, but there are also areas where more specifc methodological guidance will be important to support the next wave of scholarship. For instance, researchers must be able to identify and characterize the presence of a dark pattern, which is almost always achieved through content analysis or other similar expert inspection technique. Specifc standards of reporting will be important to allow this inspection and characterization to be falsifable and encourage a shared language regarding the presence of dark patterns in specifc, situated instances. It is also important for studies across these three types to engage in conversation with each other, including key methodological limitations. For instance, detection work has only been productive for very specifc patterns and types of functionality (e.g., consent banners, e-commerce) and future work may need to include more explicit human-in-the-loop techniques to overcome the lack of detectability of many pattern types. Similarly, experimental work should leverage and acknowledge the ecological complexity of patterns in-the-wild (often addressed in exploratory work) and not seek to diminish or reduce that complexity in ways that undermine ecological validity, while also seeking to describe the power of dark patterns on users.</p><p>Dark Patterns Scholarship Should Ofer Translational Opportunities. Although our focus was on empirical studies, we acknowledge the need to involve many stakeholders that beneft from this knowledge. As dark patterns are increasingly under legal scrutiny, how do we efectively translate and activate dark patterns knowledge across academic research, practitioner, regulator, and legal professional communities? One area of engagement that we left unexplored in this analysis could include emergent conversations in the legal community regarding dark patterns; due to diferences in knowledge generation approaches, this argumentation-focused work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,359.20,536.24,10.05,8.97" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) was excluded from our analysis in this paper but could provide cues towards transdisciplinary cooperation at the intersection of HCI and law (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,443.33,558.15,9.25,8.97" target="#b4">[5]</ref>). Other practices that could increase translation across communities could include leveraging shared vocabulary to indicate which specifc type(s) of dark patterns are being studied, in what contexts or with what type(s) of users, and with what assumptions of the underlying defnition of dark patterns. Our work could also identify common elements of reports based on the framing goal of the contribution to increase opportunities for meta-analyses of key areas of interest.</p><p>Fund (FNR, Grant No. IS/14717072 Deceptive Patterns Online (Decepticon)).

		<title level="a" type="main">(2021) Volume 2, Issue 4 Cultural Implications of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC Authors: Dr. Unsa Jamshed Amar Jahangir Anbrin Khawaja Abstract: This study is an attempt to highlight the cultural implication of CPEC on Pak-China relations, how it will align two nations culturally, and what steps were taken by the governments of two states to bring the people closer. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi&apos;s policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success. It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art and message.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators’ demand for sovereignty and revocation of ‘Special Status’ of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Is it possible for an individual to adjust in a society where he/she loses his/her individuality and becomes part of collectivity? One point of view is that for society to flourish, man needs to be repressed. But to what extent is repression necessary for societies to rise and survive? This paper shall examine the above given questions from the standpoint of two thinkers who greatly influenced twentieth-century thought: Sigmund Freud and Herbert Marcuse. To undertake this task, first the term Repression shall be examined and then the notions of Freud and Marcuse will be discussed to determine the degree of repression required for the development of modern society.

There were twelve classrooms (four from each subject of Physics, Chemistry and Biology) selected as cases. Video recording was used for the observations for six lessons in each classroom. In this way, a total of 72 observations were conducted lasting for approximately 35 minutes. Qualitative content analysis was used for data analysis through Nvivo 12. The findings of the observations revealed that all the teachers used the lecture method. They used this to cover the content at a given specific time. There was not much focus on the development of critical thinking. In a few of the classrooms, the students were engaged and active during learning different specific topics. Whiteboard was used as a visual aid by most of the teachers. Furthermore, to some extent, discussion, questioning, and daily life examples were used in different classrooms.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments.

Pakistan is a country where English is taught as a second language from the very beginning of school education. Second Language learning anxiety is a phenomenon which has been prominently found among the learners because of their less proficiency in learning English language. This study has been conducted to investigate the effect of anxiety in learning and using English language in classroom, university and outside the classroom. There are variables that affect language learning performance of the learners but this paper has solely investigated the effect of anxiety. The paper has concluded that anxiety is a variable which has a striking affect in second language learning and its use inside classrooms.

The problem of democratization and consolidation refers to the structure of democracy following the collapse of non-democratic regime. Ten factors as given by Michael J. Sodaro are considered effective in helping a democratically unstable state to stabilize its system in other words helps in the democratic consolidation. It is argued in this research that the ten factors of democratization as given by Michael J. Sodaro have been absent in the political system of Pakistan and working on these factors can lead Pakistan to the road of democratization. This study uses qualitative method of research and proposes a novel framework for the deed of parliament, because the effectiveness of parliament can contribute positively to democratization/consolidated democracy.

Malthusian view postulated as dependency ratio adversely affects economic growth while Julian Simon&apos;s view is quite different, highlighted the long-run benefits of the population in the range of 5 to15 years on economic growth. This study can be a valuable addition in research to analyzing the association of dependency ratio and economic growth of the five most populated Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, India, and Pakistan). Empirical findings of the study indicated that a total dependency and younger dependency ratio has a positive and significant influence on economic growth in both short-run and long-run scenarios while the old dependency ratio shows a negative influence on economic growth in the long run while short-run results are unpredictable. There is a need for state-based proper policy measures in focusing the higher financing in human capital development specifically in education and health.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Its geo-strategic location affects its national identity as a nation state. Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country. The constitution of Pakistan is based on principles of civilian supremacy and separation of power but in reality Pakistan’s army is the most powerful institution in country. This paper argues that the structure of Pakistani politics; created institutional imbalances by the disproportionate distribution of resources is the key variable in creating dichotomy. The structure of domestic politics is based upon the principles of hostility to India, use of Islam for national unity and strategic alliances with major powers to finance defense against the neighboring countries.

Those places were replaced by commercial or residential sites. There is also a graveyard in the city which is in the use of Hindu Valmik Sect. However, it was encroached by some Muslims due to very small size of population and indolence of the Hindus. Later on, the encroachments were removed by the District Government Lahore in compliance of order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Presently, there is a graveyard as well as a crematorium in the city.

In this study six growth models have been used for analyzing the main determinants of economic growth in case of cross countries, therefore by using these six models we have tested them for non-nested and nested encompassing through Cox test and F-test respectively. Data from 1980 to 2020 were used to analyze the cross country growth factors so therefore, the current study looked at about forty four countries with modelling these different comparative studies based on growth modelling. So, we can make these six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country. And found that in case of nested model or full model it is concluded that model with lag value of GDP, trade openness, population, real export, and gross fix capital formation are the main and potential determinants to boost up the Economic Growth in most of the countries.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses. Although many similarities have been identified between the two groups, the overall knowledge of disciplinary knowledge of English medium instruction students was not very effective, while that of UMI students was very effective.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d‘Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut’s play ‘Happy Birthday Wanda June’ was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

Althusser believes that ideology is a belief system of a society in which ideological agencies establish hierarchies in society through reinforcement and discrimination for cultural conditioning. These agencies function through ideological state apparatuses. These ideological agencies help to construct individual identity in society. The undesirable ideologies promote repressive political agendas. The non-repressive ideologies are inhaled by the individuals as a natural way of looking at the culture and society. This research seeks to investigate Omar Shahid Hamid’s novel The Spinners Tales through the lens of Althusser’s ideology and interpellation. This study examines how the characters of Shahid’s novel inhaled ideology and became its subjects. This research also depicts the alarming effects of cultural hegemony that creates cultural infidelity and hierarchies between the bourgeoisie and proletariat classes.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities&apos; powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.
