<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cookie banners, the pop ups that appear to collect your consent for data collection, are a tempting ground for dark patterns. Dark patterns are design elements that are used to influence the user's choice towards an option that is not in their interest. The use of dark patterns renders consent elicitation meaningless and voids the attempts to improve a fair collection and use of data. Can machine learning be used to automatically detect the presence of dark patterns in cookie banners? In this work, a dataset of cookie banners of 300 news websites was used to train a prediction model that does exactly that. The machine learning pipeline we used includes feature engineering, parameter search, training a Gradient Boosted Tree classifier and evaluation. The accuracy of the trained model is promising, but allows a lot of room for improvement. We provide an in-depth analysis of the interdisciplinary challenges that automated dark pattern detection poses to artificial intelligence. The dataset and all the code created using machine learning is available at the url to repository removed for review.</p></div>

Moreover, automated data collection has become almost impossible to escape <ref type="bibr" coords="1,444.24,582.26,33.24,8.74;1,133.77,594.21,50.82,8.74" target="#b4">(Auxier et al., 2019)</ref>. This data is used in ways that can impact our reality <ref type="bibr" coords="1,432.37,594.21,45.11,8.74;1,133.77,606.17,50.37,8.74" target="#b56">(Slavkovik et al., 2021)</ref>. Regulations are increasingly put in place to protect our interests. Examples include the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,174.65,630.08,135.46,8.74">(Parlament and Council, 2016)</ref> and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,193.46,642.03,84.46,8.74">(Infromation, 2018)</ref>. One of the goals of these regulations is to enforce the practice to inform and obtain consent from users about the use of data processing and data trackers <ref type="bibr" coords="1,299.96,665.94,75.65,8.74" target="#b61">(Utz et al., 2019)</ref>. In Europe, the most tangible effect of these regulations has been the appearance, and ubiquity, of consent banners on webpages. Cookie banners appear because, according to the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive (ePD) (the Council of the European Union, 2009), websites, regardless of where they are based, must inform users located in the EU about personal data collection and obtain their consent for certain purposes<ref type="foot" coords="2,171.82,186.16,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> .</p><p>As awareness of data collection and its effects increases, so does the complexity and variety of cookie banners throughout websites and different modalities.

Yet, most consent banners embedding dark patterns go undetected and unsanctioned, as data protection regulator's IT resources are largely insufficient to address all the suspected legal breaches <ref type="bibr" coords="2,310.46,546.39,80.89,8.74" target="#b0">(AccessNow, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,394.92,546.39,53.54,8.74" target="#b10">Brave, 2020)</ref>. This reality casts doubts on their real possibilities to investigate these matters efficiently, promptly and on a large scale. Thus, there is a need for technical solutions (algorithms and prototypes) to collect and analyze reliable data on dark patterns, expedite oversight tasks, warn and protect users, expose manipulative practices, and provide proof of unlawful influence to support legal proceedings. Clearly, automatic detection of the presence of dark patterns at scale is pertinent. However, dark pattern detection is a complex cognitive task which makes the use of artificial intelligence (AI) particularly challenging.</p><p>In this paper, we are concerned with this problem of using AI, specifically supervised machine learning (ML), for automating the detection of dark patterns in cookie banners. We present an initial approach. We used a rich manually labeled dataset made available by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,283.42,163.83,71.27,8.74" target="#b57">Soe et al. (2020)</ref> and supervised ML to train several prediction models that identify whether or not a cookie banner has a dark pattern. In particular, a cookie banner is represented by a data point. Herewith, we consider a data point to be a set of features of different data type values describing the position of the interface on the screen, amount of text, options given to the user, etc. Each data point is labeled with the following information: whether it has, possibly has, or is confirmed to have one of the 5 dark patterns categories defined by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,299.39,247.51,76.94,8.74" target="#b29">Gray et al. (2018)</ref>: nagging, obstruction, sneaking, interface interference, and forced action. Thus we have 15 possible different labels. A prediction model we trained assigns one of these 15 possible labels to a new data point (the interface represented as a set of features).</p><p>We report the following findings in our experiment. What we present is not a practical approach to detecting dark patterns: our approach relies on being able to encode an interface as a set of feature values before it is fed into the prediction model for dark pattern detection. To obtain values for some features, we relied on supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Some of these used features are such that their values are easy to harvest automatically, but others require human intervention instead. If humans are already looking at the interface, it is most efficient that they are directly tasked with detecting if a dark pattern is present. One can, of course, argue that laymen users cannot necessarily detect a dark pattern and we could still spare the resources for training human dark pattern detectors. Lastly, the accuracy of the predictions we obtained is not particularly high. What we present can therefore be understood as a negative result, but it should still be seen as an advancement towards making automated dark pattern detection a reality -we have learned what does work and particularly why does not work.</p><p>We discuss why attempts at automated dark patterns detection such as ours are still insufficient. While our attempt exposes many limitations to the automated detection of dark patterns, it also offers valuable lessons on how we can make progress. Towards this goal, we have made our code, prediction models and data available for anyone to build upon our efforts. We argue that the automatic detection of dark patterns requires not only machine learning, but also refinement of the concept of dark patterns and consequently improvements in regulatory initiatives.</p><p>2 Why is dark patterns detection difficult for AI?</p><p>The term dark patterns <ref type="bibr" coords="4,243.84,167.71,83.45,8.74" target="#b29">(Gray et al., 2018)</ref> has been coined<ref type="foot" coords="4,402.11,166.14,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">2</ref> to identify "instances where designers use their knowledge of human behavior (e.g., psychology) and the desires of end users to implement deceptive functionality that is not in the user's best interest" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,272.51,203.58,80.41,8.74" target="#b29">(Gray et al., 2018)</ref>. Throughout this work, we use the concept "dark pattern" to refer to types of UI dark designs that have been documented and applied to cookie banners on websites <ref type="bibr" coords="4,398.31,227.49,79.17,8.74" target="#b29">(Gray et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,133.77,239.44,97.58,8.74" target="#b49">Nouwens et al., 2020b)</ref>.</p><p>There is a growing concern that dark patterns can and will be used to i) impede ethical artificial intelligence systems by hampering the explainability and transparency of such systems <ref type="bibr" coords="4,282.56,275.31,94.93,8.74" target="#b18">(Chromik et al., 2019)</ref>, and to ii) manipulate users into sharing more data with a service than the service needs to operate <ref type="bibr" coords="4,133.77,299.22,85.30,8.74" target="#b9">(Bösch et al., 2016)</ref>. In this section, we decompose some of the challenges of automatic detection of dark patterns by AI methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Representation challenges</head><p>Artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning, has made considerable breakthroughs in image recognition and natural language processing (NLP) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,456.75,369.41,19.37,8.74;4,133.77,381.36,69.08,8.74" target="#b6">(Bengio et al., 2021)</ref>. Despite this progress, AI is deployed successfully when the different cognitive tasks are "emulated" in isolation: image recognition as one task, language processing and sentiment analysis as separate tasks. However, humans perceive a cookie banner, and any other interface, as an single visuallanguage experience. A dark pattern deceives by forcing the where the user places their attention.</p><p>For any algorithm to be able to process any kind of information, that information needs to be represented in a form that can be handled by the algorithm. For cookie banner interfaces, we have 3 representation choices: as image, as text, or as a described phenomenon (a.k.a. factorised representation). We discuss the limitations and advantages of each of these three options. Images. The input to the algorithm will be the pixels of, effectively, the screenshot of a screen image with the interface active on it. Advantage. The advantage of using images is that they are easy to collect automatically -a user can easily submit a screenshot and signal whether the image contains a dark pattern or not. A neural network can be trained using such examples of images with and without dark patterns. However, what neural network detects in images is the existence of correlation between pixels. Limitation. The image representation disregards information from the interface. Dark patterns, such as nagging, exist as an event (one image following another) and would be virtually impossible to capture in an image alone. Information within the text of the interface will also be disregarded. Two images with different text can easily end up being considered similar by a neural network even if one contains a dark pattern and the other does not. Neural networks can be expected to be successful in identifying how much of the screen does the cookie banner take up, or whether the accept and reject options in a cookie banner are implemented as the same widget. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile empirically verifying the limits of image recognition on the task of identifying visual elements of an interface.</p><p>Text. The input of the algorithm will be natural language text, or a sequence of texts and treated as a sentiment analysis problem <ref type="bibr" coords="5,365.73,223.60,106.31,8.74" target="#b15">(Chaturvedi et al., 2018)</ref>. Advantage. NLP techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis) can help to recognize dark patterns that play on linguistic features (e.g., confirmshaming, tricky questions, toying with emotion, arguments of authority, fear mongering dark patterns) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,162.85,271.42,159.89,8.74" target="#b37">(Kampanos and Shahandashti, 2021)</ref>. What would considerably further the abilities of an AI algorithm to detect dark patterns is the legal requirement that privacy options and its text (e.g. accept, reject, configure) should be balanced (or equitable) (Article 7(4) of the GDPR, further interpreted by the data protection community <ref type="bibr" coords="5,271.97,319.24,67.84,8.74">(Szpunar, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,342.89,319.24,75.26,8.74">et Libertés, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,421.20,319.24,56.27,8.74;5,133.77,331.20,21.74,8.74" target="#b53">Santos et al., 2020)</ref>). As so, it possible to automatically detect whether two antonym choices are present in the panel. Limitation. Text, compared to image, is harder to automatically scrap from online applications, particularly if the interface interaction invokes other interfaces. Cookie banners are observed to employ legal and technical jargon <ref type="bibr" coords="5,133.77,390.97,100.13,8.74" target="#b58">(Strycharz et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,237.36,390.97,69.91,8.74" target="#b61">Utz et al., 2019)</ref>, vague and ambiguous language <ref type="bibr" coords="5,454.23,390.97,18.60,8.74;5,133.77,402.93,68.49,8.74" target="#b54">(Santos et al., 2017)</ref>, and positive or negative framing <ref type="bibr" coords="5,358.78,402.93,118.70,8.74" target="#b32">(Hausner and Gertz, 2021)</ref> which hampers automatic detection of textual expressions. An open question is whether the text of the interface is sufficient to identify a dark pattern. A study that could verify or refute a positive answer to this question would be to compare the insights of one group of study participants tasked to detect dark patterns in an image of an interface, and another group tasked with detecting the dark pattern when only given the text of the interface. Such a study is outside of the scope of this work. Necessarily to denote, however, is the fact that only considering text eliminates the possibility to take into account other impacting visual cues, such as using different colors or salient hues or values representing different privacy options afforded to the user.</p><p>Features. An option is to identify a set of discerning features of the interface and record the values of those features. This option is the one we used in this paper. A supervised learning algorithm can be used to build a prediction model essentially finding a pattern in the feature values that classifies an interface as either containing or not dark patterns and identifying which one. Advantage. Building on the work of <ref type="bibr" coords="5,296.33,597.05,71.31,8.74" target="#b57">Soe et al. (2020)</ref>, a large selection of discerning features is used to describe the properties of online cookie banners from news outlets. The advantage of this approach over the other two is that interactive phenomena, such as invoking several interfaces, can be described and both visual and textual cues can be captured in the representation. In Section 3 we describe how the features from the Soe et al. (2020) dataset were processed before being used to train a prediction model. Limitation. The clear disadvantage is that some feature values will be difficult to be automatically "harvested" and virtually all feature values will require different AI post-processing techniques. Namely, after one algorithm (or a human) has identified and scraped the text, another is needed to analyse it. For example, text would require sentiment analysis, and the identification of widgets used would require a image processing. Instead, an ideal approach, and one open problem for future work consists in identifying the features whose values can be automatically scraped and post-processed and which are most relevant to distinguish a dark pattern. The more precise the definition of dark patterns, the easier it is to identify the relevant features. A separate limitation of the features approach is the challenge of humans being able to correctly label the data points with the right dark pattern. We discuss this issue next.</p></div>

There is very limited case-law in the EU concerning the use of UI, which refers mainly to the prohibition to use pre-checked boxes (of Justice of the European Union, 2019). Non-mandatory guidelines from Data Protection Authorities provide further interpretation on UI elements, wherein feature parity is is given priority to. The UK DPA (Office, 2019, p. 32) observed that "a consent mechanism that emphasises 'agree' or 'allow' over 'reject' or 'block' represents a non-compliant approach, as the online service is influencing users towards the 'accept' option." The French DPA <ref type="bibr" coords="6,430.96,425.30,46.52,8.74;6,133.77,437.25,73.78,8.74">(Chatellier et al., 2019, p. 28</ref>) frames as "Attention Diversion" the design choices that draw attention to a point of the site or screen to distract or divert the user from other points that could be useful. This guidance states that visual and color saliency is effective and commonly used, indicating that using a green hue on a "continue" button while leaving the "find out more" or "configure" button smaller or in a lighter shade of grey, users may perceive green as the preferable choice. Conversely, in the US, the Congress (on Digital Platforms, 2019) is considering issuing legislation restricting dark patterns, and the CCPA (Infromation, 2018) defines and prohibits dark patterns associated with privacy consent which have a "substantial effect of subverting or impairing a consumer's choice to opt-out".

Challenges to detect intention and deception. Besides UI-based elements (e.g. feature inequality), there is also the question of whether AI can capture intention and deception in cookie banners. If we define dark pattern's existence as an attempt for deception, we need to detect whether and when intention to deceive exists. Existence of intention is very difficult to prove and it is hard both for humans and for machines. Challenges to detect contextual, social and cognitive aspects. Another detection problem refers for context awareness (e.g. temporal, social, cognitive aspects) which are hard to capture. The ability to process all the contextual information at once, holistically remains a hard problem in AI. As of today, AI methods process different types of information differently: for example, text is different than image processing (as mentioned in section 3.1). Within the UI there is a richness of information that is transmitted to the user that needs to be accounted to: the placement of the interface in the screen, the ratio of the interface size vs the screen size, the contrast between different colors used, the finer linguistic nuances of the text used, etc. Herein, the inputs of the HCI community is of essence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Summary</head><p>Ultimately, dark pattern detection is difficult for AI because it is difficult also for people. It is difficult to capture all the specific instances in which a particular design choice constitutes a dark pattern. The analysis of Soe et al. ( <ref type="formula" coords="7,138.38,502.70,18.45,8.74">2020</ref>) reveals that reviewers struggled to agree upon on which dark pattern is present in a cookie banner -more than option applied, given a low interreviewer reliability. A better, more context specific, definition can contribute to at least eliminate this human labeling uncertainty problem. A common vocabulary for the identification, description and categorization of dark patterns (and in concrete contexts) is needed for its comprehensive detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>All of the machine learning tasks, except word embedding, was done using the Scikit-learn library 4 on a Jupyter notebook. Since the word embedding with Universal Sentence encoder and clustering is more computationally intensive, the task was performed with Tensor Flow<ref type="foot" coords="8,309.78,126.39,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_5">5</ref> library on the Google Collaboratory<ref type="foot" coords="8,470.24,126.39,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_6">6</ref> , a cloud computational platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Dataset</head><p>Data collection. We started with the manually collected and annotated dataset of 300 websites described in <ref type="bibr" coords="8,295.52,198.15,71.28,8.74" target="#b57">Soe et al. (2020)</ref>. The dataset of the Soe et al. ( <ref type="formula" coords="8,161.62,210.10,18.45,8.74">2020</ref>) is available on https://github.com/videoworkflow/cookiepopup. We split this dataset and use it in training and testing. This data set describes the cookie banners that were encountered in each of the visited websites. Each website was visited on a browser running on a laptop computer in an Incognito mode by a reviewer who recorded information about the websites containing cookie banners. All websites were news outlets, in English or in a Scandinavian language.</p><p>The list of features and values from the dataset for the cookie banner from Vice.com is listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,250.75,305.74,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and labels are listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,386.52,305.74,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The description of the meaning of the features follows. Information. The information collected from each website (cookie banner) can be categorized into: basic website information, cookie banner related information and dark patterns. The basic website information consists of an URL, name of the website, country of origin of the website and type of the website (news or magazine). The data about the cookie banner contains the following information:</p><p>-information related to whether a direct reject option is directly available in the interface, or alternatively is the user expected to interact with links to other interfaces or instructions for changing browser settings;</p><p>-information on whether the reject option, when available, is of the same type of widget as the accept option (e.g. whether both are buttons or links);</p><p>-location of the pop up interface on the screen: up, bottom, centre; -information on whether the website was accessible while the cookie pop up was active;</p><p>-number of clicks required to "reject all" consent choices (whenever such possibility existed).</p><p>The dataset also includes the privacy policies and the cookie policies as extracted text. In addition, it includes different cookie types used and explanation of the purpose of the cookie types for which the permission for which use is required. This information was not used in our experiments, but it has been parsed and translated into English using Google Translate and made available in our dataset and in the ¡GitHub link removed for review¿ file as a SQL lite database. Dark patterns in cookie banners. 1. Site ID (siteid) -the identifying name of the website; 2. Widget Level (widgetlevel) -the differences in design between the options of "accepting all" and "rejecting all" in cookie banners (this is in the form of semi-structured text); 3. "Not yes" (nameofnotyes) -the text within the first UI element (link or button) that only eventually leads to an opt out from tracking (semistructured text);</p><p>4. Location of the pop up (location) -the location of the cookie pop up on the website (this is a description in the form of semi-structured text);</p><p>5. Does the cookie banner disable the website (contentblocking) -whether the website is accessible and scrollable while the pop up is active. It is yes/no (binary) data with some comments;</p><p>6. Words number on the option page (optionswordscount) -the number of words on the the first "layer" of the cookie banner options (ordinal data integers);</p><p>7. Number of clicks required for rejecting all consent (clickstorejecttall)the number of clicks required to reject all possible cookie banners on the website (ordinal data integers);</p><p>8. Does the website lists the purpose of the cookies (iscookieusedlisted)whether the third party cookie list is provided or not (it is binary data with comments); 9. Were there any third party cookies on the website (thirdparty) declaredthe number of third party categories used (semi-structured text); 10. Does the website work after rejecting all Cookies (iteworkafterrejectingcoookies) -whether the site works after all cookie purposes are rejected (it is binary data with some comments);</p><p>In addition to these listed features, the dataset also contains other features herewith mentioned:</p><p>Comments from the data collector reflecting upon the easiness, clarity and understandability regarding the information presented in the interface. As intentional lack of clarity can be an instrument of deception, and thus indicative of a dark pattern, we considered these reflections to be potentially relevant features that we would like to use in training a supervised model for dark pattern detection; Type of widget options. Lastly, the dataset contains information regarding whether the actionable options are of the same type of widget and what that widget is. To be able to use it, we need to split this information into two features: equality of widget level, and type of widget. This process was used to create the features equality of widget level and type of widget we used a tokenizer and stemmer. This, and other pre-processing is described in Section 3.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Feature pre-processing</head><p>Cleaning. Since manual annotated data contains inconsistencies from typos and comments intended to be read by humans, we cleaned up the data first.</p><p>Cleaning up of the data was done with using Python scripts and manual correction of some typos on Microsoft Excel. Cleaning reduces the possibility of annotation mistakes degrading the performance of machine learning algorithms on our dataset. Text processing. Text processing included the following steps: translation, sentiment analysis and clustering explained below. Translation. Our dataset contains texts from multiple languages. Therefore, all non-English texts were translated into English language using Google Cloud Translate<ref type="foot" coords="10,174.53,648.07,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_7">7</ref> via its Python API.</p><p>Tokenization. To remove the differences in language used in the original websites and hand annotated text, texts are parsed and simplified with NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) 8 library in Python. In particular, we applied NLTK tookit's Tokenizer to remove extra spaces and punctuation marks and NLTK Stemmer to replace different forms of words with their root form (e.g. the root form of does, did and done is "do").</p><p>Sentiment analysis. After translation of all the text fields sentiment analysis is performed using Google Cloud Language 9 . Sentiment classification was applied to the collectors reflections in the dataset about the quality of options in the cookie banner. Sentiment classification returns two data points, namely, sentiment and magnitude. The sentiment scores ranges from -1 (negative sentiment) to 1 (positive sentiment). The magnitude represents the magnitude of the sentiment regardless of positive or negative sentiment.</p><p>Clustering. For "not yes" options text, we performed a clustering analysis to find groups in different "not yes" option texts. For that purpose, we used Universal Sentence Encoder <ref type="bibr" coords="11,260.30,307.29,76.77,8.74" target="#b13">(Cer et al., 2018)</ref> to embed phrases used in "not yes" option into the vector space. The Universal Sentence Encoder ensures that phrases that are similar or closer in meaning are embedded closer together in the vector space. It was necessary to use some form of embedding for the phrases as comparing differences in alphabets between two phrases does not work for finding the similarity in semantics.</p><p>Example of pre-processing. For illustration purposes, we convey an example on clustering of the "not yes" option text feature. During the data collection, the text that indicates an alternative to accepting consent was collected as a separate text feature regardless of whether the text appeared on a button or as link.</p><p>Translation. The "not yes" option text in the dataset is unstructured and contains words in multiple languages. To be able to use it for a training machine learning model, we firstly need to translate it into English (as the majority of the data points were in English), which was performed using the Google Cloud Translate API with Python client library 10 . Each "not yes" option text was individually fed into the API to ensure that each of them is processed on its own.</p><p>Clustering. The translated text was inspected manually, and we observed that the phrasing of the text label "not yes" option varies. A number of different but similar phrases, e.g. "Read more" and "More information". As per Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,469.73,552.37,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, it would be "Configure Preferences", though other options ranges from "Learn More" to "Options" are found in the dataset. Therefore, clustering is applied to discover different categories or clusters of the "not yes" text. First, the "not yes" phrases, now all translated to English, were encoded into vectors using the Universal Sentence Encoder <ref type="bibr" coords="11,261.40,612.14,76.21,8.74" target="#b13">(Cer et al., 2018)</ref>. Text embedding -a popular method used in Natural Language Processing before tasks such as clustering, 8 https://www.nltk.org/ 9 https://googleapis.dev/python/language/latest/usage.html 10 https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/reference/libraries/v3/python translating, classification and similarity -, in our case with Universal Sentence Encoder, converts the phrases into 512 dimensional vectors or an array with 512 values.</p><p>Visualization. Since it is impossible to visualize 512 dimensions, we used Principle Component Analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" coords="12,310.41,175.78,69.00,8.74" target="#b51">(Pearson, 1901)</ref> to reduce the dimensions to 2 so that the text embedding can be plotted and visually analyzed. It was quite clear from the visualization that the data can be clustered into six clusters. We used K-means method <ref type="bibr" coords="12,294.77,211.65,58.72,8.74" target="#b41">(Lloyd, 1982)</ref> for clustering. The clusters are visualized and the resulting clusters are plotted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="12,403.81,223.60,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The rest of the features which are not mentioned in this subsection only required general clean up such as removal of special characters, correction of typos and removal of additional comments from the reviewer. The final set of cleaned and transformed features used to train a prediction model for dark pattern detection is summarized in the Table <ref type="table" coords="12,334.02,575.59,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_3">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data labeling</head><p>The dataset of Soe et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="12,245.88,621.87,75.13,8.74" target="#b57">(Soe et al., 2020)</ref> was not collected with the purpose of being used as training data in machine learning. The data points in that dataset were "labeled" with information on the identified types of dark patterns from <ref type="bibr" coords="12,158.53,657.74,82.87,8.74" target="#b29">(Gray et al., 2018)</ref>. However, the identification of these dark patterns  was done by two independent reviewers for each data-point, who acted without coordinating or agreeing on how to identify the patterns. The reviewers more often than not disagreed on which specific dark pattern was present. As a result, there were a lot of inconclusive results among the reviewers and also some disagreement of whether there was indeed a dark pattern (one reviewer noted the presence of dark pattern, while it was not noted by the other).</p><p>We needed to find a way to work with these somewhat ambiguous labels. We adopted the following labelling:</p><p>• No dark pattern usage detected (Integer value 0) is assigned when both reviewers noted the absence of a dark pattern. No dark pattern usage found by both reviewers.</p><p>• Possible dark pattern usage (Integer value 1) is assigned when only one reviewer noted the presence of a dark pattern. Possible dark pattern usage.</p><p>• Confirmed dark pattern usage (Integer value 2) is assigned when both reviewers noted the presence of a dark pattern. Dark pattern usage is confirmed by both reviewers.</p><p>In this work, we train the machine learning model with these three labels, thereby classifying the dataset into: samples with no dark pattern usage, samples with possible dark pattern usage (only one reviewer found it), and samples with confirmed dark pattern usage.</p><p>The distribution of the labels is depicted in Table <ref type="table" coords="14,367.46,175.78,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. Therein, the labels are not evenly distributed, and in particular, nagging and sneaking dark pattern categories have negligible or no confirmed samples. This is the result of the difficulties in detecting these dark patterns mentioned by the collectors of the dataset (Soe et al., 2020).</p></div>

We used this feature importance measure to help us understand and interpret features and labels, but we did not use this for training machine learning classifiers. The obtained results are depicted in Figures 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, and 3e. The feature is given in the Y-axis and the feature importance, measured on a scale of 0 to 1, is given on the X-axis. We observe that not all of the feature importance values were equally useful in interpreting the data. For example, location of the pop up as a feature is estimated to be highly important for identifying the dark pattern nagging, see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,183.16,524.13,8.49,8.74" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>, which makes sense and already confirmed in the study of <ref type="bibr" coords="14,461.71,524.13,15.77,8.74;14,133.77,536.08,54.39,8.74" target="#b61">Utz et al. (2019)</ref>, as a pop up that is displaying in the middle of the page can be considered as nagging every time a user browses the web. However, the two features estimated as most important for the dark pattern forced action -the purposes (iscokieusedlised ) and clarity of options (clarityofoptions), see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,165.20,583.90,8.12,8.74" target="#fig_4">3e</ref>, do not really make sense.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Classification of dark patterns using machine learning</head><p>The type of features and number of data points in the dataset very much dictated the choice of supervised machine learning classifier we could use. We chose to use the Gradient Boosted Tree method for classifying the detected dark patterns<ref type="foot" coords="15,457.91,190.05,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_9">12</ref> as a mix of categorical and continuous features is best solved by decision tree-based classification <ref type="bibr" coords="15,193.05,215.53,74.28,8.74" target="#b25">(Friedman, 2001)</ref>.

The split was done by randomly assigning data points to either the test or training data set.</p><p>Five different "Gradient Boosted Tree classifiers" are trained, one for each of the five dark patterns. The models are trained independently for each dark pattern and each of the five models attempts to predict whether a presented dark pattern is of three class labels, namely, 0-No dark pattern usage detected, 1-Possible dark pattern usage and 2-Confirmed dark pattern usage. Table <ref type="table" coords="15,456.43,442.68,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_5">5</ref> list the accuracy score the machine learning models for each type of dark patterns categories. The accuracy score is the mean accuracy score for each of the three class labels in our test dataset weighted by their numbers relative to the total samples in the test dataset. For each of the class label the accuracy score is computed as number of correctly identified samples divided by total numbers of samples with that label in the test dataset. As we can observe, the worst accuracy is obtained for the Interface Interference dark pattern, just 0.535, which is a still better than random -a completely random classifier will achieve 0.33 accuracy in this case.</p><p>Since we are dealing with a multi-class classification problem, confusion matrices were created for each of the classifiers. These confusion matrices add to the information provided in the accuracy table by displaying the performance in terms of predicted labels and actual labels. The rows are actual labels in our dataset and columns are predicted labels from our machine learning models. The cells represent the ratio of actual label that are classified as predicted labels for the corresponding rows and columns. The diagonal line from top left to bottom right represents the values of correct predictions and the rest of the cells are incorrect prediction of different kinds.

For the rest of the dark patterns, the automated classification is plagued by difficulties for reviewers in identifying the dark patterns, as explained below. Further work would be needed regarding implicit characteristics on the other categories.</p><p>Lessons learned. From our experiment and the yielding difficulties observed, we would like to share the most important takeaways that can inform other automated dark pattern detection initiatives based on ML. 1-Labelling dataset and codebook.

In fact, the current dataset from <ref type="bibr" coords="16,191.85,660.14,71.08,8.74" target="#b57">Soe et al. (2020)</ref> is not yet suitable for automatic analysis. Better labels are necessary for the dataset and it can be achieved by clarifying the identification of dark patterns by reviewers. Doing so requires a dark pattern classification which is different from <ref type="bibr" coords="17,295.51,151.87,79.40,8.74" target="#b29">Gray et al. (2018)</ref> and thus more specific and amenable to cookie banners. Accordingly, additional research is needed to improve codebook consensus across dark pattern classification and its inherent characteristics, and alongside accounting for newly identified patterns in future work <ref type="bibr" coords="17,159.13,199.69,115.09,8.74" target="#b36">(Johanna Gunawan, 2021)</ref>. On this stance, <ref type="bibr" coords="17,358.52,199.69,81.09,8.74" target="#b30">Gray et al. (2021)</ref> propose for an holistic, n-dimensional dark patterns analysis in furtherance for such a consensual dark patterns definition.</p><p>2-Guidelines. Such codebook could be further coupled with guidelines for reviewers quality labels. The guidelines should be specific enough to allow for maximal agreement among reviewers on which dark pattern is present. This in turn imposes again the request for a better definition of dark patters. There is a limit to how precisely a dark pattern can be defined since when doing so, one can also abolish it. Dark patterns are tricky because "It is rarely possible to foresee which new patterns are going to emerge, and as a result, detection measures are always reactive, and rely on practitioners that constantly update the existing pattern databases as well as engaged consumers that point out new occurrences". <ref type="bibr" coords="17,199.56,343.15,118.43,8.74" target="#b32">(Hausner and Gertz, 2021)</ref>. Thus, guidelines may need to be continuously updated and limited to a particular context of use.</p><p>3 -Clustering. The process for redefining the dark pattern category for cookie banners could also be done using machine learning by considering a corpus of cookie banners and analyzing clusters within them. Similarity patterns among cookie banners might yield new insights to what new dark pattern definitions can be. We can then use these patterns which are more "visible" to a machine to train a prediction model.</p><p>4 -Mixed approach. An automated approach combined with manual methods could ensure better results towards detecting dark patterns in cookie banners. As we discussed in the Introduction, some features can be difficult to harvest by machines but can be precisely defined and easily identified by people, even when the people do not necessarily agree on which dark pattern they are looking at. Some dark patterns, such as nagging, would only be detectable with a human observing their behaviour.</p><p>5 -Dark Patterns conceptual refinement.

As Johanna Gunawan (2021) posits, additional research is needed to develop the theory of dark patternblindness and potential mitigation strategies in order to detect more accurately the presence of dark patterns.</p><p>Policy and legal implications. Any AI computational system aiming to detect dark patterns should align to detectable issues that are already deemed illegal by authoritative sources. But there are only few (mandatory) legal rules in Europe constraining the use of dark patterns, and enforcement is slow in holding websites accountable. The only mandatory decision ascertaining any UI based aspect is dated of 2019 forbidding the use of pre-ticked boxes (of Justice of the European Union, 2019). From Article 7(3) of the GDPR ("it shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent", it can be interpreted that privacy choices should be equal (e.g. parity in accept, reject and revoke choices) <ref type="bibr" coords="18,417.08,151.87,60.39,8.74;18,133.77,163.83,22.69,8.74" target="#b53">(Santos et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="18,160.15,163.83,98.68,8.74" target="#b49">Nouwens et al., 2020b)</ref>.

In the future, we need to see a more serious approach to enforcement, either by courts, or by decisions issued by data protection authorities.

(2019)</ref> analyzed ∼53K product pages from ∼11K shopping websites, and discovered 1,818 dark pattern instances, together representing 15 types and 7 broader categories. The goal of their work is to present "automated techniques that enable experts to identify dark patterns on a large set of websites in one particular category". The process presented is done in three steps:. The first step is corpus creation through crawling Alexa top websites which are ranked according to monthly web traffic. From that list of top traffic websites, a tool called Webshrinker is used to categorize into shopping or not shopping categories. After that, only English language websites are kept resulting in the final list of 19,455 shopping websites. The second step is data collection of the product checkout pages. The third step is data analysis on the product checkout pages using using Hierarchical Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) <ref type="bibr" coords="19,133.77,127.96,97.47,8.74" target="#b12">(Campello et al., 2013)</ref>.

Some patterns are easier to detect than others, and some are impossible to detect in an automated fashion.

By applying the implemented algorithm to more than 4000 German websites extracted from a list of the top one million web sites according to Alexa.com, around 2800 cookie banners were extracted and analyzed. By utilizing features like the HTML tag of elements, they obtained a large amount of clickable elements within the banners.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We considered the problem of automatically detecting the five dark patterns of <ref type="bibr" coords="20,146.17,206.64,81.30,8.74" target="#b29">Gray et al. (2018)</ref> by training a supervised machine learning model using the data set of <ref type="bibr" coords="20,201.55,218.59,70.86,8.74" target="#b57">Soe et al. (2020)</ref>. Our approach can be considered naive, since the data set used was relatively small and not well balanced -dark patterns of different type occur with different frequency in the data set. However, as we discussed throughout the paper, creating a training dataset is a considerable challenge in its own right. It requires a combination of human effort, automated extraction of feature values and pre-processing of extracted material using various AI technologies such as clustering and sentiment analysis. Furthermore, unlike related work, we attempt to detect dark patterns directly, rather than specific features that make the pattern dark, like for example widget inequality, which is much less ambitious.</p><p>We used this experiment primarily as a spring-board to better understand the problems of using machine learning for automating dark pattern detection. We present a detailed analysis on the challenges involved and consider this our main contribution. Our experiment allows us to clearly outline promising directions of future work.</p><p>Clearly, a pipeline of various methods and techniques would eventually need to be constructed for a functioning automated dark pattern detection tool. To construct it we need to decompose the experience: dark patterns into elements that can be automatically, or at least easily processed. This is a task that requires expertise in human-computer interaction and cognitive science. It is also a task that is perhaps easiest tackled when focusing on one specific domain at a time. For example cookie banners should be considered as one domain, whereas privacy settings another.</p><p>Visual cues and components of a dark pattern should be explored as an image recognition problem. To this end, we need to construct a common resource, a collection of labeled images, one for each visual cue. For example: one collection of images that contain screenshots of cookie banners with different level widgets.</p><p>What the Soe et al. ( <ref type="formula" coords="20,237.15,541.38,18.45,8.74">2020</ref>) dataset shows, is that there is a lot of variety in the textual information that describes the purposes of the data collection, cookies, trackers etc. We did not explore how to use this text in our approach, but one should consider that the dark pattern here is the volume and language style of the text, rather than the information it is supposed to convey. As with images, a common resource needs to be created to create training data for a supervised learning algorithm that would label text as confusing or comprehensible, using feature that describe the volume of text and various linguistic cues such as legalese.</p><p>In our work, we were not able to identify clear distinguishable features that would discern among the dark patterns.

Dark patterns. The term dark patterns <ref type="bibr" coords="29,317.34,191.62,80.16,8.74" target="#b29">(Gray et al., 2018)</ref> has been coined<ref type="foot" coords="29,469.04,190.05,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_12">15</ref> to identify "instances where designers use their knowledge of human behavior (e.g., psychology) and the desires of end users to implement deceptive functionality that is not in the user's best interest" <ref type="bibr" coords="29,320.04,227.49,77.76,8.74" target="#b29">(Gray et al., 2018)</ref>. Throughout this work, we use the concept "dark pattern" to refer to types of UI dark designs that have been documented and applied to cookie banners on websites <ref type="bibr" coords="29,451.93,251.40,25.56,8.74;29,133.77,263.36,51.06,8.74" target="#b29">(Gray et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="29,188.22,263.36,97.79,8.74" target="#b49">Nouwens et al., 2020b)</ref>. Gray et. al. define five park patterns categories from: nagging, obstruction, sneaking, interface interference, and forced action.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Name Description Nagging</head><p>A minor redirection of expected functionality that may persist over one or more interactions. Nagging often manifests as a repeated intrusion during normal interaction, where the user's desired task is interrupted one or more times by other tasks not directly related to the one the user is focusing on. Obstruction Impending a task flow, making an interaction more difficult than it inherently needs to be with the intent to dissuade an action. Obstruction often manifests as a major barrier to a particular task the user may want to accomplish.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sneaking</head><p>An attempt to hide, disguise, or delay the divulging of information that has relevance to the user. Sneaking often occurs in order to make the user perform an action they may object to if they had the knowledge. Interface interference Any manipulation of the user interface that privileges specific actions over others, thereby confusing the user or limiting discoverability of important action possibilities. Interface interference manifests as numerous individual visual and interactive deceptions. Forced action Any situation in which users are required to perform a specific action to access (or continue to access) specific functionality. This action may manifest as a required step to complete a process, or may appear disguised as an option that the user will greatly benefit from.  <ref type="bibr" coords="29,288.37,539.58,80.90,8.74" target="#b29">(Gray et al., 2018)</ref> and their definitions Legal requirements for consent in cookie banners. Consent is defined in Article 4(11) and complemented by Articles 6 and 7 of the GDPR which state that for consent to be valid, it must satisfy the following seven requirements: it must be prior, freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous, must be readable and accessible, and finally, revocable. Unambiguous means that consent must be given through an active behavior of the user through which she indicates acceptance or refusal to online tracking. Such active behaviors can consist of: "clicking on a link, or a button, box, image or other content on the entry webpage, or by any other active behavior from which a website operator can unambiguously conclude it means consent" (Article 29 Working Party, 2013). Accordingly, silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent and violate such unambiguous requirement (Recital 32 GDPR, (of Justice of the European Union, 2019)). The unambiguous requirement entails that privacy options (accept, reject, revoke, configure, know more) should be balanced (or equitable) (Article 7((4) a contrario, GDPR <ref type="bibr" coords="30,392.69,211.65,84.79,8.74" target="#b53">(Santos et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="30,133.77,223.60,52.90,8.74">Office, 2019)</ref>). Websites failing to comply with these GDPR requirements face fines up to 4% of their annual revenue or 20 million euros (Article 83(5,6)).</p><p>Impact of dark patters in the user decision making process. Deployment of dark patterns by online services are observed to be effective at bending people towards choices that are not in their own interest, impacting their decision-making process.</p><p>Studies. The effect of dark patterns is evidenced in a growing studies and experiments.

Their work showed that subtle dark patterns are easily unnoticed than ostensive ones, and that less-educated people are prone to be influenced than more educated subjects. <ref type="bibr" coords="31,148.71,139.92,137.24,8.74" target="#b40">Kulyk et al.

However, they also show that even after removing a nudging and manipulative design choice, a form of routinised conditioning could still persist, ultimately leading users to behave in a certain way, due to an irreflective default behavior.</p><p>Summary. Building on this body of knowledge made us realize the following: i) user's decision making process is impacted by dark patterns; ii) users might be aware and recognize them, though they are unable to resist them, and are bound to the immediate trade-off; iii) some dark patterns are not so easy to be detected by users due to habituation to deceptive design and due to incorrect mental models. As such, automated detection of dark patterns and due reporting to decision-makers (data protection authorities) seems to be the appropriate and neutral intervention to ease autonomous decision-making and counteract manipulative designs online.     </p></div>

		<title level="a" type="main">(2021) Volume 2, Issue 4 Cultural Implications of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC Authors: Dr. Unsa Jamshed Amar Jahangir Anbrin Khawaja Abstract: This study is an attempt to highlight the cultural implication of CPEC on Pak-China relations, how it will align two nations culturally, and what steps were taken by the governments of two states to bring the people closer. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

With the application of containment Policy, the U.S. achieved much success in international politics. Over time China has become more powerful and sees great power in international politics. China wants to expand and launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The primary purpose of The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to achieve support from regional countries and save their interests from the U.S. In 2017, the American administration launched its Containment policy through Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) to keep their interest from China. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is comprising of Australia, the United States, Japan, and India. This Study is based on Qualitative research with theoretical application of Game theory. This research investigates both plans of China (BRI) and the U.S. (the Quad) through a Game Theory. In this study, China and the U.S. both like to act as gamers in international politics. This study recommends that Game theory can predict all developments in the long term.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi&apos;s policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies. This research work examines, how Narendra Modi became the strongest person in India.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success. It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art and message.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators’ demand for sovereignty and revocation of ‘Special Status’ of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

All the students from two years master (M.A) degree programme and four years (BS) degree programme of eight departments from International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI), Faculty of Social Sciences were taken as a population of the study. 475 students were randomly selected as a sample of the study. The Academic Advising Inventory (AAI) was used to assess Academic Advising Style. For measuring level of the satisfaction, descriptive statistics was used. To compare the mean difference department-wise and gender-wise about academic advising satisfaction t.test was applied. It was concluded that from the major findings of the study those students who received departmental academic advising style are more satisfied as compared to those students who provided prescriptive academic advising style. Female students seemed more satisfied as compared to male students regarding the academic advising style provided to them. Students who satisfied from developmental academic advising style and they were also highly satisfied from the advising provided to them at Personalizing Education (PE) and this is the subscale of developmental academic advising whereas students who received prescriptive academic advising they were also satisfied from the advising provided to them regarding personalizing education and academic decision making but their percentage is less. It is recommended to Universities Administration to focus on Developmental Academic Advising Style and establish centers at universities/department level and nominate staff who may be responsible to provide developmental academic advising.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Is it possible for an individual to adjust in a society where he/she loses his/her individuality and becomes part of collectivity? One point of view is that for society to flourish, man needs to be repressed. But to what extent is repression necessary for societies to rise and survive? This paper shall examine the above given questions from the standpoint of two thinkers who greatly influenced twentieth-century thought: Sigmund Freud and Herbert Marcuse. To undertake this task, first the term Repression shall be examined and then the notions of Freud and Marcuse will be discussed to determine the degree of repression required for the development of modern society.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Its geo-strategic location affects its national identity as a nation state. Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country.

In this study six growth models have been used for analyzing the main determinants of economic growth in case of cross countries, therefore by using these six models we have tested them for non-nested and nested encompassing through Cox test and F-test respectively. Data from 1980 to 2020 were used to analyze the cross country growth factors so therefore, the current study looked at about forty four countries with modelling these different comparative studies based on growth modelling. So, we can make these six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country. And found that in case of nested model or full model it is concluded that model with lag value of GDP, trade openness, population, real export, and gross fix capital formation are the main and potential determinants to boost up the Economic Growth in most of the countries.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d‘Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut’s play ‘Happy Birthday Wanda June’ was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum. The play shows how toxic masculinity rooted in power and capitalism exploit both women and environment.

The Quran claims that it is a book which explains every situation; therefore, the aim of this study remained to extract those verses of Surah Al-Baqarah which can guide us in Economics. The authentic and approved Islamic clerics and their translations were consulted for the interpretations of the Holy verses. The researchers chiefly focused and studied Surah Baqarah with regards to social equity and economic opportunities. The translations were primarily in the regional language Urdu so the interpretations must not be related exactly equitable in English. The study engaged the document analysis research strategy.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

The natives are majorly involved in illegal transportation of goods and objects, therefore; the study sets to explain how significant smuggling for the local people is. It describes the kinship role in reciprocity of their trade and transportation. The qualitative methods such as purposive sampling and interview guide were employed for data collection. The research findings revealed that local people were satisfied with their illegal trading which is depended largely on their expertise and know-how of smuggling at borders. They disclosed that their total economy was predominantly based on smuggling of stuff like drugs, diesel, oil, gas, petrol, ration food from Iran, and human trafficking. They also enjoyed the privilege of possessing Sajjil (Iranian identity card), thus; the dual nationality helped them in their daily business and rahdari (border crossing agreement), enabling them to travel to Iran for multiple purposes.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

Althusser believes that ideology is a belief system of a society in which ideological agencies establish hierarchies in society through reinforcement and discrimination for cultural conditioning. These agencies function through ideological state apparatuses. These ideological agencies help to construct individual identity in society. The undesirable ideologies promote repressive political agendas. The non-repressive ideologies are inhaled by the individuals as a natural way of looking at the culture and society. This research seeks to investigate Omar Shahid Hamid’s novel The Spinners Tales through the lens of Althusser’s ideology and interpellation. This study examines how the characters of Shahid’s novel inhaled ideology and became its subjects. This research also depicts the alarming effects of cultural hegemony that creates cultural infidelity and hierarchies between the bourgeoisie and proletariat classes.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

Daughters became curses and liability for parents causing serious consequences. For control, there are legal ban/restrictions (Dowry and Wedding Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976; Amendment in Act, 1993) on its practice in Pakistan. Despite the legal cover, the custom has been extended. Dowry amount seems to be increasing due to changing lifestyle and trends of society. To understand males’ and females’ perceptions about dowry; impacts of dowry; why dowry is essential; and how it is affecting women’s rights and eventually affecting women’s autonomy. A qualitative study was conducted. Data was collected by using unstructured interviews from males and females including social activists, economists, and married couples about wedding expenses, demands, society pressure, men’s support, and perception against dowry especially with regards to women’s rights and autonomy. The study concluded heavy dowry especially in terms of furniture, electronics, kitchenware, car, furnished houses, and cash highly associated with women’s development and their rights. General people’s perception showed that dowry is no longer remained a custom or tradition in Asian countries. It is just a trend and people follow it as a symbol of respect for parents and women as well.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities&apos; powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.
