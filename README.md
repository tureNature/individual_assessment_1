# individual_assessment_1

This project leverages Grobid, a powerful document processing tool, to analyze 10 open-access articles following class best practices. The program automatically extracts keywords from article abstracts, forming a visually informative keyword cloud that highlights key topics. Additionally, it identifies and quantifies figures in each article, presenting a graphical representation of figure distribution. Furthermore, the program compiles a comprehensive list of embedded links in each article, offering a convenient resource reference.
